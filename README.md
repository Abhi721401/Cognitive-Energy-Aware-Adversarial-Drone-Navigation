## 📌 Overview

CEAADN addresses a core challenge in autonomous drone navigation: how to fly from point A to point B while **simultaneously minimizing energy consumption, avoiding radar detection, handling wind resistance, and navigating terrain hazards** — all in real time.

Rather than relying on a single algorithm, CEAADN stacks three layers of intelligence:

| Layer | Method | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| 🗺️ Global Planning | A\* on multi-objective cost map | Fast, reliable baseline path |
| 🧠 Risk Embedding | Graph Neural Network (GCN) | Learns terrain risk beyond raw cost |
| 🤖 Local Adaptation | PPO Reinforcement Learning | Re-routes around high-radar segments |

- **A\* baseline planner** with 8-directional movement on a grid graph
- **3-layer GCN** trained to predict terrain risk embeddings from node features
- **PPO RL agent** trained with imitation reward shaping from A\* path guidance

## ⚙️ Configuration

All key parameters are in **Cell 2** of the notebook:

```python
GRID  = 64          # Grid resolution (use 32 for fast testing)
START = (2, 2)      # Drone start position
GOAL  = (61, 32)    # Drone goal position (offset — not diagonal)

# Cost function weights
ALPHA = 0.4   # Energy (slope)
BETA  = 0.3   # Radar detection
GAMMA = 0.2   # Wind penalty
DELTA = 0.1   # Terrain/river risk
```
## 🗺️ Visualizations

The notebook generates 6 interactive Plotly figures:

| # | Figure | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | 🚁 3D Flight | Cinematic 3D mountain terrain with all 3 flight paths, radar towers, shadows, direction cones |
| 2 | 📊 4-Panel Heatmaps | Elevation, radar detection, GNN risk, cost map side by side |
| 3 | 🗺️ 2D Top-Down | All paths overlaid on cost map with radar markers |
| 4 | 📈 Altitude Profile | How each drone climbs and descends across the mountain |
| 5 | 📊 Bar Chart | Energy / exposure / steps comparison across all methods |
| 6 | 🧠 GNN Loss Curve | Training convergence of the terrain risk predictor |

## 🧠 Method Details

### Multi-Objective Cost Function
```
C(x) = α·E(x) + β·D(x) + γ·W(x) + δ·R(x)
```
- **E(x)** — Energy cost (terrain slope)
- **D(x)** — Radar detection probability (line-of-sight + distance decay)
- **W(x)** — Wind opposition penalty (dot product of wind vs. movement direction)
- **R(x)** — Terrain risk (river zones, low elevation)

### GNN Architecture
- 3-layer GCNConv with BatchNorm and ReLU
- Input: 6 node features per cell `[elevation, slope, wind_x, wind_y, detection, river]`
- Output: learned risk score in `[0, 1]`
- Trained with MSE loss to predict the cost map

### PPO RL Agent
- Operates on **local 15×15 patches** around high-radar A\* segments
- Reward: `8·progress − 0.5·detection − 0.2·cost + guide_bonus`
- Two-stage curriculum: A\*-guided (80k steps) → independent (60k steps)
- Greedy fallback + A\* stitch as safety net

## 🔭 Future Work

- [ ] Real DEM data (SRTM / NASA elevation datasets)
- [ ] Dynamic radar (moving adversaries)
- [ ] 3D altitude control (not just 2D grid)
- [ ] Multi-drone coordination
- [ ] Transformer-based path planner replacing GNN
- [ ] Real-time replanning on partial map updates
